## Description
Modern, high-throughput assays allow us to efficiently profile a variety of biological processes to gain a systems-level understanding of health and disease. Recent technologies and experimental assays generate an abundance of detailed information that needs to be extracted, summarized, and interpreted. In this course we will discuss the methodology used to extract signal from (e.g. process, engineer features from, combine, etc.) data generated by some of the most cutting-edge experimental paradigms, such as single-cell assays and imaging. We will go into detail about the methods and theory underlying bioinformatics algorithms, originating from numerical linear algebra, graph-signal processing, and machine learning. While computational biology is a very broad field, we will focus here on applications in single-cell biology (CyTOF, single-cell RNA sequencing), multiomics/multi-modal analysis, systems immunology, and benchmarking. For each class of algorithms introduced for some task on biological data, we will also go over necessary theory and mathematical intuition. The course covers the foundations for biomedical data science and does not assume any biological knowledge.

## Prerequistes
Students should be strong in programming in Python or Julia or R, and be comfortable with linear algebra and basic probability. **I do not assume any prior biological knowledge. Any relevant concepts will be introduced**. Please feel free to talk to me about any of these prerequistes. 

## Course Structure
This course will be mostly lecture-based with two homework assignments and a course project. I will provide ideas for several publicly available biological datasets and open problems for you to work on for these projects. Overall, the project is intended to give you an opportunity to implement/apply methodology discussed in the papers that we will discuss together. The final project writeup will also give you practice writing up results and communicating ideas. You are welcome to work on teams for this project.

Students will also pick any two days during the semester to answer a set of reading questions about one of the assigned papers.

# Homework, Project, Reading, Grading, Etc

## Homework
There will be two homework assignments to practice implementing particular concepts. Often, things can become a bit easier to understand and use when they are implemented by you. I will provide code and hints in Python, but will be happy to read/run code written in Python, R, Julia, or Matlab. Please submit your homework writeup as a PDF. 

## Background Resources
Most of what we discuss in class will come from papers. However, I suggest the following textbooks as background references. Conveniently, they are also available for free.

## Readings
Each student much choose two class meetings to answer reading questions for one of the discussed papers. Please answer the following questions and send the responses in PDF format to me by the beginning of our class meeting. 

### Reading Questions

**Please choose 2 papers over the course of the semester to do this for, and turn them in before our class meeting 9:30 am to natalies+comp790@cs.unc.edu**. 

1) Please explain in 2 sentences or less what the problem being solved is.

2) What were the main contributions of the authors in this work? (You can answer in a few bullet points). 

3) Please describe 1-2 computational experiments that the authors implemented to test their method.

4) Were the authors the first to attempt this particular problem? If not, did they compare their results to other baselines? Do you think that their evaluation was objective?

5) Do you think that the authors provided enough evidence for why their developed method is an important contribution? If yes, please describe their reasoning here. If you do not think they adequately justified why they worked on this particular problem, please describe your thoughts on that here. 

6) What is one follow-up idea or extension from this work? 

## Final Project
I will provide you with several examples of publicly available biological datasets and problems (https://github.com/natalies-teaching/Comp790-166-CompBio-Spring2022/blob/main/Datasets.md). Half-way through the semester, you will submit your project proposal and present your idea to the class.  The proposal will be a short document describing 1) The problem 2) A background on other people's attempts to solve this problem and 3) A background on your idea of a solution and 4) the data you will use to test your method. At the end of the semester you will write a short paper explaining your method and results and present your results.

## Grading
 Grading will be based on the following

1) Reading Questions : 15% -- sufficiently 2 completed during the semester
2) Homework 1: 20%
3) Homework 2: 20%
4) Project Proposal : 10%
5) Project final writeup: 30%
6) Class Participation and Attendance : 5%

## Lateness Policy

I understand if things come up. If you need more time on your homework or project proposal, you are welcome to talk to me about it. However, if you simply turn in your homework late without any prior notice, I will deduct 10% of the points per day. There will be no late submissions of the course project permitted. 

## Mask Usage

I don't anticipate any problems with this, but if you do intent to join the class in-person, please make sure to wear a face mask covering your nose and mouth. 

## Accessibility Statement
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a temporary disability or pregnancy complications resulting in barriers to fully accessing University courses, programs and activities.

## Diversity Statement
I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. I broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. I strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve, I appreciate suggestions.
